# ABL Notebook Pointer & Notes

This file previously contained embedded VSCode.Cell XML fragments that interfered with markdown rendering and tools. Those XML fragments have been removed.

What to use instead
- Primary notebook for tower-based curvature diagnostics:
  - /Users/davidengland/Documents/GitHub/ABL/notebooks/01_tower_curvature_analysis.ipynb
- For an index of available notebooks and usage guidance see:
  - /Users/davidengland/Documents/GitHub/ABL/notebooks/README.md

Quick instructions
1. Open the repository root and launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
   - jupyter lab
2. Navigate to `ABL/notebooks/` and open `01_tower_curvature_analysis.ipynb`.
3. If you previously pasted notebook XML here, remove that paste and keep notebook files under `notebooks/`.

If you want the original VSCode.Cell XML restored into a notebook file, I can convert those cells into a proper .ipynb file — tell me and I will produce the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
