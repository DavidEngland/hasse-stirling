There are several Python libraries and tools used in the analysis and simulation of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL).
Relevant libraries and tools include:
pyABL: Python code for serial and parallel ABL analysis.
MetPy: An open-source, Python-based package for meteorology, used to analyze ABL-related data and processes.
(LS)²D (large-eddy simulation and single-column model-large-scale dynamics): An open-source Python tool that downscales ERA5 data via LES (Large Eddy Simulation) to increase the resolution of atmospheric processes, useful for ABL studies.
CLASS4GL (Chemistry Land-surface Atmosphere Soil Slab model for GLobal studies): This Python module simulates ABL evolution and land-atmosphere feedbacks.
ACT (Atmospheric Data Community Toolkit): A library of Python codes for atmospheric science datasets.
General Scientific Libraries: ABL studies often use scientific Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and xarray for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Machine learning libraries like Keras and TensorFlow have also been used in ABL wind profile estimations.
The library you found might be one of these or another specialized tool. Please specify a library name or a particular ABL task for further assistance.
